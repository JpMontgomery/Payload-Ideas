sulfur dioxide sensor
chlorine detector to measure ozone depletion 
spectrometer to measure atmospheric ozone
hydrocarbon sensor
PAH detection in the air (would be the most interesting if we launch after other rockets have launched)
star tracker to measure the rocket's attitude relative to inertially fixed celestial bodies 
magnetometer to measure the magnitude and direction of a planet's magnetic field 
(the last two are probably unreasonable since we launch during the day)
